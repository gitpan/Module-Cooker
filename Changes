    Changed call from instance method basename_dir to class method _basename_dir
    in modcooker.
    Added GitHub info to Cooker.pm
    Implemented '--copy' option in modcooker.
    Added --available option to bin/modcooker to show available profiles and
    whether or not they are from the standard distro, have been overriden, or
    are strictly local.
    Added support for Storable::dclone where needed to deter tampering by
    outside code.
    Added more read-only methods
    Changed to use public method 'basename_dir' instead of private
    method '_basename_dir'.
    Added basic modcooker.cfg template for modcooker.
    Added test support for read-only methods.
    Added entries for 'modcooker.cg' and 'MANIFEST.SKIP' to MANIFEST.
    Added method 'basename_dir' to provide a more consistent public API to an
    internal value, changing _basename_dir to be strictly a private use
    utility method.
    Added test for 'basename_dir' to test suite.
    Added note about bug in AppConfig that prevents hash keys being specified
    on the command line using Getopt::Long.
    Added logic for --setup to modcooker script
    Added logic to bin/modcooker to allow the command line options for

    in others.
